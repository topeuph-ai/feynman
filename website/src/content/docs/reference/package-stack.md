Feynman is built on the Pi runtime and uses curated Pi packages for its capabilities. Packages are managed through `feynman packages` commands and configured in `~/.feynman/settings.json`.

## Core packages

These are installed by default with every Feynman installation. They provide the foundation for all research workflows.

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pi-subagents` | Parallel agent spawning for literature gathering and task decomposition. Powers the multi-agent workflows |
| `pi-btw` | Fast side-thread `/btw` conversations without interrupting the main research run |
| `pi-docparser` | Parse PDFs, Office documents, spreadsheets, and images for content extraction |
| `pi-web-access` | Web browsing, GitHub access, PDF fetching, and media retrieval |
| `pi-markdown-preview` | Render Markdown and LaTeX-heavy research documents as polished HTML/PDF |
| `@walterra/pi-charts` | Generate charts and quantitative visualizations from data |
| `pi-mermaid` | Render Mermaid diagrams in the terminal UI |
| `@aliou/pi-processes` | Manage long-running experiments, background tasks, and log tailing |
| `pi-zotero` | Integration with Zotero for citation library management |
| `@kaiserlich-dev/pi-session-search` | Indexed session recall with summarize and resume UI. Powers session lookup |
| `pi-schedule-prompt` | Schedule recurring and deferred research jobs. Powers the `/watch` workflow |
| `@samfp/pi-memory` | Pi-managed preference and correction memory across sessions |
| `@tmustier/pi-ralph-wiggum` | Long-running agent loops for iterative development. Powers `/autoresearch` |

These packages are updated together when you run `feynman update`. You do not need to install them individually.

## Optional packages

Install on demand with `feynman packages install <preset>`. These extend Feynman with capabilities that not every user needs.

| Package | Preset | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pi-generative-ui` | `generative-ui` | Interactive HTML-style widgets for rich output on macOS. The upstream package currently declares macOS-only support |

## Installing and managing packages

List all available packages and their install status:

```bash
feynman packages list
```

Install a specific optional preset:

```bash
feynman packages install generative-ui
```

On Linux and Windows, `generative-ui` is hidden from `feynman packages list` and explicit installs print a platform message instead of attempting an npm install.

## Updating packages

Update all installed packages to their latest versions:

```bash
feynman update
```

Update a specific package:

```bash
feynman update pi-subagents
```

Running `feynman update` without arguments updates everything. Pass a specific package name to update just that one. Updates are safe and preserve your configuration.

This command updates Pi packages inside Feynman's environment. To upgrade the standalone Feynman app itself, rerun the installer from the [Installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation).
